# Identification of general market tendencies

The project concerns the identification of underlying market tendencies within long-term (several decades) financial and macroeconomic data, which is publicly accessible. It is supervised by Guillaume Lecu√© (__CREST__) and the Data Science branch of the __Bank of France__. The team is composed of four M1 students, as part of our Applied Statistics course at __ENSAE Paris__ :
- Alexis Ayme
- Aeson Feehan
- Romain Ilbert
- Aaron Mamann

The methods used are part of a larger initiative at the Bank of France to elaborate and compare machine-learning algorithms allowing the identification of market tendencies and the prediction of economic crises.
